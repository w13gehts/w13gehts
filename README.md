ðŸ˜„ Hey, I'm Juliana from Brazil. I'm a formed Game Designer that used to work as social media in a PR agency focused on Games and Esports. I got some SEO and Digital Marketing skills because of it. Now I work as Junior IT Management Analyst.

âš¡ Fun Fact: 
I consider myself an artist and I never thought I could work with coding someday. It all started when I had to deal with WordPress at my last job, after a while I noticed that some of the problems I was facing could be easily solved with coding. Then I decided to study coding just for fun (aka to feel like I could be able to have some logical reasoning).

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can always find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianasalafia/) or check out my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/juliana.salafia). I also have [Instagram](https://instagram.com/w13gehts) but it's just everyday life.
