ðŸ˜„ Hey, I'm Juliana Rousseau and I am from Brazil. I'm a formed Game Designer currently working as social media in a PR agency focused on Games and Esports. I got some SEO and Digital Marketing skills because of it. 

âš¡ Fun Fact: I'm mostly an artist, but I'm curious about how programming can also be a path nowadays. I decided to give a shot for programming because I had to deal with WordPress in my job, after a while I started to notice that some of the problems I was facing would be easily solved with coding and, let's be honest, I don't want to be stuck with plug-ins forever.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can always find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianasalafia/), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/jssalafia) and [Digital Innovation One](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/users/juliana_salafia).
